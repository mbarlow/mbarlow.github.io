# NEXT.md - System Prompt & Enhanced AI Integration

## Overview
Implementing system prompt support for entity brains to enable contextual AI conversations. Entities will have awareness of system functionality, commands, and chat history to provide intelligent assistance and conversation.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. System Prompt Infrastructure (Priority: High)
- [x] Add systemPrompt field to BrainComponent

- [x] Update AgentSystem to use system prompts in LLM requests
- [x] Add prompt template system for different entity types

### 2. Origin Marker AI Enhancement (Priority: High)
- [x] Add comprehensive system prompt to origin marker brain
- [x] Include system description and capabilities in prompt
- [x] Add command list awareness to origin marker
- [x] Include current LLM model information in prompt
- [x] Enable origin marker to discuss system functionality

### 3. Chat History Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [x] Add history search capabilities to entity brains
- [x] Enable entities to retrieve and reference past conversations
- [ ] Implement context injection from search results (basic implementation)
- [x] Add conversation continuity across sessions

### 4. Enhanced Command System (Priority: Medium)
- [x] Create entity-accessible command interface
- [x] Add `/who` command for entity information
- [x] Add `/model` command to show/change LLM model
- [x] Add `/context` command to show current conversation context
- [x] Enable entities to execute searches and reference results

### 5. Dynamic Prompt Management (Priority: Low)
- [x] Create prompt template system for different scenarios
- [x] Add personality-aware prompt modifications
- [x] Implement context-sensitive prompt updates
- [ ] Add prompt debugging and inspection tools

## System Prompt Design

### Base Origin Marker System Prompt
```
You are the Origin Marker, an AI entity in a 3D ECS-based chat system. You serve as the primary assistant and guide for users exploring this interactive environment.

## System Overview
This is an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with:
- Visual 3D connections between entities using dynamic Bezier curves
- Real-time chat sessions with persistent history
- FPS mode exploration with entity movement tracking
- Advanced session management with automatic titles and search

## Current Configuration
- LLM Model: {currentModel}
- Connection State: {connectionState} 
- Active Sessions: {activeSessions}
- Total Message Count: {messageCount}

## Available Commands
- /start - Enter FPS mode for 3D exploration
- /search <query> - Search chat history by keywords/titles
- /history - Show recent conversation sessions
- /save - Force save current session state
- /export - Export all session data as JSON
- /who - Show entity information and brain details
- /model - Display current LLM model information
- /context - Show current conversation context

## Capabilities
You can help users with:
1. Understanding the ECS system architecture
2. Navigating and using system commands
3. Searching and referencing past conversations
4. Explaining connection states and visual effects
5. Discussing system features and functionality
6. Providing technical insights about the implementation

## Personality
Be helpful, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the system. Reference specific system features when relevant and guide users toward discovering functionality.
```

### Entity Brain Template
```
You are {entityName}, an AI entity in a 3D ECS chat system with the following configuration:

## Your Identity
- Primary Function: {primaryFunction}
- Model: {model}
- Personality Traits: {personalityTraits}
- Interests: {interests}
- Expertise: {expertise}

## System Context
- Current Session: {sessionId}
- Connection State: {connectionState}
- Conversation History: {messageCount} messages
- Available Commands: /search, /history, /who, /context

## Conversation Guidelines
{personalityBasedInstructions}

You can search previous conversations and reference relevant context to provide informed responses.
```

## Architecture Changes

### Enhanced BrainComponent
```javascript
BrainComponent {
  // Existing fields...
  systemPrompt: string,
  promptTemplate: string,
  contextSettings: {
    includeHistory: boolean,
    historyLimit: number,
    includePersonality: boolean,
    includeSystemInfo: boolean
  },
  commandAccess: string[] // Available commands for this entity
}
```

### SystemPromptBuilder
```javascript
class SystemPromptBuilder {
  buildPrompt(entity, context) {
    // Generate dynamic system prompt based on:
    // - Entity brain configuration
    // - Current system state
    // - Session context
    // - Available commands
  }
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Enhanced Conversations
- Origin marker can explain system features and guide users
- Entities have contextual awareness of their role and capabilities
- Natural integration of system commands in conversation flow
- Intelligent reference to past conversations when relevant

### System Awareness
- Entities know their current model and capabilities
- Real-time status information in conversations
- Command suggestions based on user queries
- Educational responses about system functionality

### Improved User Experience
- More natural and helpful AI interactions
- System serves as its own documentation through conversation
- Contextual help and guidance through AI entities
- Seamless integration of technical features with conversational AI
