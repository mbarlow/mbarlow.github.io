### Component Relationships
```

â”œâ”€â”€ senderId
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”œâ”€â”€ timestamp
â””â”€â”€ type (user/llm/system)

BrainComponent
â”œâ”€â”€ model (ollama model or "human")
â”œâ”€â”€ personality (traits object)
â”œâ”€â”€ primaryFunction
â”œâ”€â”€ currentStatus
â”œâ”€â”€ emotion
â”œâ”€â”€ interests
â”œâ”€â”€ sessionHistory (array of session IDs)
â””â”€â”€ notes
```

## Suggestions & Improvements

### 1. Connection Pooling
Instead of creating/destroying connections frequently, maintain a pool of inactive connections that can be reactivated. This improves performance and memory usage.

### 2. Message Batching
For high-frequency messaging, batch messages before updating the visual connectors to reduce rendering overhead.

### 3. Session State Machine
Implement a proper state machine for sessions:
- `pending` â†’ `connecting` â†’ `active` â†’ `idle` â†’ `inactive` â†’ `archived`

### 4. Connection Types
Consider different connection types:
- Direct chat (1-to-1)
- Broadcast (1-to-many)
- Group chat (many-to-many)
- System notifications

### 5. Visual Enhancements
- Use gradient colors for connection state transitions
- Add particle effects along active connections
- Implement connection "strength" based on message frequency
- Show message flow direction with animated particles

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Implement connection LOD (Level of Detail) - simpler curves at distance
- Frustum culling for connections outside view
- Lazy-load chat history (only load recent messages initially)
- Use IndexedDB for local session storage

### 7. Entity Discovery
Add a discovery system where entities can:
- Broadcast availability
- Search for entities by brain traits
- Auto-connect based on interests

### 8. Security & Privacy
- Add connection permissions (accept/reject)
- Implement message encryption for sensitive chats
- Add entity blocking capabilities

### 9. Analytics
Track connection metrics:
- Message frequency
- Session duration
- Popular topics (from keywords)
- Entity interaction patterns

### 10. Future Extensions
- Voice chat integration
- File/media sharing through connections
- Collaborative workspace sessions
- Connection history visualization (timeline view)

## Current Status
